# Introduction

In today’s information-rich society, many organizations have started practicing data-driven decision-making (DDDM). This practice has a more transformative impact on companies compared to traditional methods; a focus on the underlying data can turn complicated observations, patterns, and behaviors into meaningful insights. As information becomes more and more accessible overtime, there will always be the endless improvement regarding how we utilize data to make positive, ethical decisions.

My name is Colin and I have a passion for data because it helps us 1) make more intelligent decisions and 2) better predict potential outcomes of our decisions. These two capabilities alone can play a significant role in our efforts to make this world a better, safer place across all aspects of life, and that's why I pursued a career in data.

I've provided a handful of projects I completed while participating in a 12-week data science bootcamp. I hope this portrays the power of data so please enjoy! 

# Projects

### 1. SAT Participation Rates 
https://github.com/cmondi151/Project_A-SAT_Participation_Rates

#### Overview
Discovered underlying patterns & trends in historical standardized test scores and participation rates at the state-level; given these findings, a data-driven proposal was developed recommending the College Board allocate additional funds to a specific set of low-partaking states in order to increase SAT participation rates.

### 2. Kaggle Competition - Ames, Iowa Housing Prices
https://github.com/cmondi151/Project_B-Housing_Prices

#### Overview
Developed, tested, and enhanced several price prediction regression models against a housing dataset containing 80 features for ~2,000 properties; the top-preforming model generated a well-fit, unbiased model resulting in minimal differences of predicted versus actual sales prices.

### 3. Reddit Posts Classification
https://github.com/cmondi151/Project_C-Reddit_Posts_Classification

#### Overview
Constructed a word-frequency classification model using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques in order to identify which subreddit a post originated from; utilizing reddit’s pushshift API to extract multiple independent subreddit feeds, the model successful matched 91% of posts to the correct subreddit.

### 4. Kaggle Competition - Amazon Alexa Reviews
https://github.com/cmondi151/Project_D-Amazon_Alexa_Reviews

#### Overview
For this hackathon challenge students were given a single day to pick a tabular dataset and make a predictive model. Similiar to Project 3 above (Reddit Post Classifications), I decided to do a sentiment analysis for Amazon Alexa reviews (Kaggle Competition). The goal was to predict what rating (score of 1 - 5) an individual gave the Alexa they recently purchased using only the content from their written review.

Given the short amount of time to complete this, there's a limited amount of cleansing, EDA, pre-processing, and model testing applied in this project in comparison to the other projects in my repository.

##### Additional Notes
All projects were done using Python via JupyterLab. For additional information regarding individual projects, refer to the README file available in each project repository.

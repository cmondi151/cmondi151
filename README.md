# Introduction

Hello - I'm Colin and I have a passion for data... the ability to turn complicated observations, patterns, and behaviors into meaningful insights is a facsinating, groundbreaking capability that I believe will lead to a better future! In today’s information-rich society we’re starting to recognize decision-making backed by data-driven outputs can result in more predictable and positive outcomes. But as more information becomes available, endless improvement regarding data utilization is required to continuously make both intelligent and ethical decisions. So we need more data folks like you to make this happen!

Recently I decided to take part in a data science bootcamp to continue building my skillset. One of the primary reasons I enrolled was to continue working towards my long-term career goal, which is to obtain a leadership position where I can apply my expertise to create significant value in dynamic, data-rich environments I have the opportunity to work in. This bootcamp has helped push me closer to that goal and I'd recommend anyone interested in learning more about data science to enroll in a formalized educational program focused on data science.

For those interested in my work, provided are a handful of projects I completed while partaking in the course. I hope you enjoy! 

# Projects

### 1. SAT Participation Rates 
https://github.com/cmondi151/Project_A-SAT_Participation_Rates

#### Overview
Discovered underlying patterns & trends in historical standardized test scores and participation rates at the state-level; given these findings, a data-driven proposal was developed recommending the College Board allocate additional funds to a specific set of low-partaking states in order to increase SAT participation rates.

### 2. Kaggle Challenge – Ames, Iowa Housing Prices 
https://github.com/cmondi151/project_B-Housing_Prices

#### Overview
Developed, tested, and enhanced several price prediction regression models against a housing dataset containing 80 features for ~2,000 properties; the top-preforming model generated a well-fit, unbiased model resulting in minimal differences of predicted versus actual sales prices.

### 3. Reddit Post Classifications 
https://github.com/cmondi151/project_C-Reddit_Posts_Classification

#### Overview
Constructed a word-frequency classification model using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques in order to identify which subreddit a post originated from; utilizing reddit’s pushshift API to extract multiple independent subreddit feeds, the model successful matched 91% of posts to the correct subreddit.

### 4. One-Day Hackathon Challenge: Kaggle Competition - Amazon Alexa Reviews
https://github.com/cmondi151/project_D-Hackathon_Challenge

#### Overview
For this project students were given one day to pick a tabular dataset and make a predictive model. Similiar to Project 3 above (Reddit Post Classifications), I decided to do a sentiment analysis for Amazon Alexa reviews (Kaggle Competition). The goal was to predict what rating (score of 1 - 5) an individual gave the Alexa they recently purchased using only the content from their written review.

Given the short amount of time to complete this, there's a limited amount of cleansing, EDA, pre-processing, and model testing applied in this project in comparison to the other projects in my repository.

##### Additional Notes
All projects were done using Python via JupyterLab. For additional information regarding individual projects, refer to the README file available in each project repository.
